# Django docs tutorial
Notes taken while following the Django docs tutorial.
### Automatic reloading of runserver.
> The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.
